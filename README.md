# Stock Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a **Stock Data Analysis Dashboard** created using **Power BI**. The dashboard integrates both **Stock Market** and **Cryptocurrency** data to provide insights into historical trends, performance, and volatility of various assets. The data is fetched from multiple sources and is visualized to help investors make informed decisions.

The analysis includes **stocks** such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Google (GOOG), as well as popular cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**.

## Features
- **Stock Data Visualization**: Interactive charts for stock performance over time.
- **Cryptocurrency Data**: Visualizations for cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, XRP, and DOGE.
- **Key Performance Metrics**: Overview of stock performance, including high, low, and close prices.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Dynamic dashboards with multiple chart types such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.

## Technology Stack
- **Power BI**: For building interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis (optional, used for generating synthetic data and managing datasets).
- **Pandas**: For handling and analyzing data.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting charts and graphs.
- **GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project.

## Data Source
The data used for this project includes stock data and cryptocurrency data, which was either fetched from external APIs (for live data) or generated synthetically for demonstration purposes. A sample dataset `combined_data.csv` is provided in this repository.
