Stock Data Analysis Power BI
Overview
This project involves building a Stock Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI and Python. The dashboard is designed to visualize stock and cryptocurrency data, perform analysis, and display the results using various types of charts. The data is fetched from various financial sources and visualized with interactive charts, helping users to analyze and interpret market trends over time.

Features
Stock and Crypto Analysis: The dashboard shows data for stocks and cryptocurrencies, including open, high, low, close, and adjusted close prices, along with volumes.
Dynamic Visualizations: Various types of charts like Line Charts, Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Candlestick Charts, Donut Charts, and more are used to visually represent the data.
Power BI Integration: Integrated Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard to explore stock data trends.
Python Data Analysis: Used Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to fetch, clean, and analyze the data before presenting it in Power BI.
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize stock and cryptocurrency data using Power BI and Python. The dashboard helps users:

Track stock market performance over time
Compare the performance of different stocks and cryptocurrencies
Perform trend analysis and prediction using historical data
What was done:
Data Preprocessing: Data was cleaned and processed using Python.
Visualization: A variety of charts were created, including:
Line and Stacked Line charts
Pie, Donut, and Bar charts
Candlestick and Area charts
Ribbon charts
Analysis: Insights were generated using Power BI to display stock and crypto data.
Technologies Used
Power BI: For creating interactive visual dashboards.
Python: For data processing and creating various visualizations.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For charting and visualizing data.
python-pptx: For generating presentation slides showcasing the analysis.
